Fractional order derivatives and symmetric neural networks

# Folder: data_coefs 
contains 10000 functions that were generated by randomly mixing terms with different coefficients (between -2 and 2) and degrees (max 4)

# Folder: data_zeros 
contains 10000 functions that were generated by using zeros (between 0 and 2)

# nnet_train_full.py 
main code using the data to train a SYMMETRIC neural network that predicts a full order derivative

# data_process.py
code for data post-processing

Because the datasets are large (100Mb), the author will send them separately (at request).
